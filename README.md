# PrognosAI

This repository presents PrognosAI, an integrated machine learning system designed to improve healthcare delivery in resource-limited environments. By utilizing advanced neural network architectures, PrognosAI analyzes real-time sensor data to evaluate patients' vital signs, providing clinicians with timely, accurate information. This project addresses critical issues in healthcare, including delays in diagnosis, lack of access to specialists, and overwhelmed medical staff. With its ability to support faster decision-making and enhance the quality of care, PrognosAI aims to transform healthcare accessibility, particularly in underserved communities.
